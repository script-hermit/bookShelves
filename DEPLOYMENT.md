## üì± Mobile Optimization Tips

Your app is already mobile-responsive, but for better mobile experience:

1. **Add to Home Screen** - works like a native app
2. **Offline Support** - already has service worker
3. **Touch Gestures** - drag & drop works on mobile

## üîê Environment Variables

Remember to set up your environment variables in your hosting platform:
- `VITE_GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY`
- Firebase configuration variables

## üîß Custom Domain (Optional)

Most hosting platforms allow you to connect a custom domain:
- Buy a domain from any registrar
- Point it to your hosting platform
- Enable HTTPS (usually automatic)

## üìä Recommended Workflow

1. **Development**: Local server with network access
2. **Testing**: Deploy to Vercel/Netlify for testing
3. **Production**: Custom domain + CDN for best performance

Your bookshelf app is now ready to be accessed from anywhere! üéâ
